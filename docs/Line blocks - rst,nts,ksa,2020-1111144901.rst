        | I'm absolutely skint.
        | But I'm expecting a postal order and I can pay you back
        as soon as it comes.
        | Love, Ewan.

            | Half a bee, philosophically,
            |     must, *ipso facto*, half not be.
            | But half the bee has got to be,
            |     *vis a vis* its entity.  D'you see?
            |

            |     or not to be an entire bee,
            |         when half the bee is not a bee,
            |             due to some ancient injury?
